        # first scramble is just one word
        # reverse two indices
        # particularly good to use is to switch the first two
        # and the last two
        # this only makes sense if you have a world that is longer than 3


        # now try to scramble one sentence
        # do just words first, then you can move on to work on
        # punctuation
